  <p>Léim Irish Dance was founded in 2000 by a group of students passtionate about
  Irish dance. They saught to create a club where they could continue their
  dancing while teaching others the skill.
</p>
<p>
  The first show comprised of just 8 dancers and 4 numbers. Now, with over 25
  dancers, our annual show consists of over a dozen dances and takes place in
  Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre every January. The team also competes annually in a
  competetion in Dayton, Ohio and performs at events both on and off campus
  throughout the year.
</p>
<p>
  Members range from lifelong competitive Irish dancers to students who have
  never danced before.
